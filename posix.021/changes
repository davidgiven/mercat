CHANGE LOG
==========

September 9 1998
----------------

Major bugfixes; a lot of that-shouldn't-be-working ones, particularly in the
AVL tree manager.
ASSERT() macro and lots of debugging code.
Tested under Linux. *Really* works this time.

September 3 1998
----------------

Ditched rhide's bogus makefile, and wrote one of my own.
Created config.h (for portability).
Added my own (untested) implementation of atoi for those platforms that
don't have it (such as Linux. Bizarre!).
Tested under Linux. Works.
