THINGS TO DO
============

Yes, well, where do I start...

Lots of compatibility stuff. Lots of feature enhancements. The SCR module
needs to have proper ISO Latin 1 support. The assembler needs rewriting
completely. The compiler needs the missing features implemented (delete()
on dictionaries, function pointers, proper precedence on operators, better
syntax for defining arrays...) and needs a better interface (like,
sometimes it's nice not to emit debugging information).

Oh, yes, and there's the D word. Documentation. I need some. Anything. And
if there's one thing I hate it's writing documentation.

If it helps, I have an incredibly bad memory when it comes to remembering
how programs work. Coming back to the compiler after spending some time on
the VM was quite an experience. It took me about a week to work out what I
did in the routines that analyse types, and then I wrote huge comments
describing how they did it. But on the whole I could understand it all
reasonably easily. What? I'm actually pointing out how clear my code is by
saying how easily *I* could understand this? I need to go to bed! It's
past midnight!
