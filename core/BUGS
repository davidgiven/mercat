BUG FILE
========

This is an incomplete listing of bugs that I have noticed and haven't got round
to fixing.

---start---

Operators of the same precedence are right-associative rather than left
(1-1+2 == -2, not 2).

Referencing a variable before it's allocated causes a crash --- a feature
rather than a bug, but needs a compiler warning.

System calls must be defined before where they are called, or the compiler
generates a function call rather than a system call.
