INTRODUCTION
============

This is an alpha release of my Mercat virtual machine.

The Mercat system comprises a compiler, assembler and a run-time system. The
run-time system is written in C; the rest of it is, of course, written in
Mercat. All languages that are worth their weight in HD floppies are
self-hosting. 

This file describes the source release of the Posix version of the
run-time system. If you want the compiler and assembler, or precompiled
versions of the run-time, then see the web page at:

	http://wiredsoc.ml.org/~dg/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?Mercat

QUICK START GUIDE
=================

1. Edit config.h. It is self-documenting.
2. Edit Makefile. You probably won't need to change anything if you use
gcc.
3. make

This will build an executable called `mi' (or `mi.exe' under DOS). See the
core readme file for information on how to use it.

DOS SPECIFICS
=============

DOS, being DOS, is awkward. If you're using DJGPP then things should be
pretty straightforward. If you're using Borland for a 16-bit build...
well, I haven't tried that yet.

FEEDBACK
========

Comments should go to dg@tao.co.uk.
Food, money, mailbombs etc go to 31 Sturbridge Close, Lower Earley, Reading
RG6 4EE. (Actually, don't send me that last. This is a rented house.)

LICENSE
=======

The little grey men with briefcases made me put this bit in. Anyway. It's mine,
all mine[*], you can use it for non-commercial purposes but can't
redistribute it without my permission. If you wish to make changes send them
back to me and I'll integrate them into the rest of the system.

[*] Except for the Paranoia game. This is my port of Tim Lister's
implementation. He, in turn, took the text from an article by Sam Shirley. See
the top of paranoia.mi for more information.
